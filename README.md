# JetbrainsAcademyProjects
This is the repository where all my code for the training projects of the course "Kotlin Developer" and "Kotlin Basics" from JetBrains is located.
Each individual project is a class named after the project, which simply wraps the project code with all its classes and functions.  
  
## The repository contains code for the following projects:
__Cinema Room Manager__

__Simple Search Engine:__  
In this project you will create your own search engine, though it probably won’t compete with Google. 
Yours will be a simple search engine that processes a limited collection of data and searches it for a word or a phrase. It’ll be simple but cool.
